        Journey to Motherhood in the First Year After Child Birth
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200">
        Becoming a mother in all societies has been considered as the most crucial role for women. Although some women avoid childbearing or defer it, becoming a mother is mostly inevitable. The birth of the first child despite being a happy event, puts the mother into crisis and lots of stress and faces her with new roles and responsibilities. The first year after childbirth is not only a vital period regarding the physical, emotional, and psychological development, but also a significant time for challenging first -time mothers’ capacities in adjusting to their maternal roles.
        The scrutiny of the mothers’ experiences in this study exhibits that during the first days and weeks postpartum mother experiences contradictory emotional states which indicate her incapability of perceiving her current situation and circumstances, and her new maternal role. She feels like she is not prepared enough to face the new situation as a mother and feels confused and bewildered, constantly thinking that her current status is inconsistent with her former expectations and the world she used to imagine about the child’s appearance and her life with a child. Fitting into her new role confronts the mother with new expectations which can, in turn, contribute to this feeling of unpreparedness. Not only does she set herself up with new expectations as a mother, but suddenly comes up against others’ expectations of herself for which she is not ready.

    <p>Feeling of inadequacy in controlling affairs especially during the first days and weeks after birth is outstanding among mothers’ experiences. The mother who used to live her normal life before childbirth, suddenly feels a loss of control over her life affairs and therefore develops a deep sense of inconvenience and trouble accompanied by a feeling of incapacity which derives from lack of self-assurance. Fear and anxiety about her child’s health and her future, etc. on the one hand, and concerns about the inefficiency of her feelings and attitudes toward the child on the other hand, add to this lack of mastery over life affairs. New moms experience a sense of neediness more than any other time. This feeling of neediness especially a desire to receive social, emotional, and practical supports is another indication of decreased control over the new circumstances.
      
      Mother’s competence and her capability in performing her role as she fulfils the needs of the child and those of the family and herself is indicative of the stability of maternal role and mother’s adjustment to it. Mothers’ contentment with the situation which is expressed through their description of life with a child as good and satisfactory suggests their dominance and control over affairs. Improvement of the child’s temperament, enhancement of mother’s physical and emotional state, and diminution of her fears and concerns about the child’s health which is brought about as the child grows, are all influential in developing a sense of satisfaction with the current situation. Maternal role satisfaction is probably the most notable indicator of contentment with conditions and mastery over affairs.
      Feeling like a truly grown up was also shared by all mother participants. This kind of feeling is not due to being aroused or receiving more respect and social acceptability as a mother but stems from their behavioral changes and their new way of looking at matters.
      Stability of family bonds is another event that reveals itself over time through the strengthening of marital relations. By the internalization of maternal role and other aspects of maternal adaptation (as mentioned earlier) the conjugal relationship between husband and wife improves and returns to its normal state. The participants also reported indications of a development in the mutual expressions of affection with their husbands and a warmer and more intimate association between them which signifies an improvement of emotional attachments between couples.
      By the consolidation of marital relations, the family concepts and values promote as well. Increased mutual trust ,the warmth and joy brought about for the couple, and the construction and reinforcement of the concept of” family” which takes place as the two- membered family changes into a three-membered one, are all influential in strengthening the family bonds.
      “My husband and I didn’t use to trust each other and he refused to tell me many things before; he was closer to his own family than to me but since we have got a child we trust each other more than before… we feel more joy in our life. I am also more busy and entertained by the baby and life is less monotonous as if there was a gap which is now filled with our child.”
      Increased attachment of mother to her family life and her being more attentive and thoughtful in making decisions are the signs of family stability.

        All About Baby Growth Spurts
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200">
        Your newborn baby will grow rapidly in the first couple of months, and sometimes you'll suspect that your baby has grown overnight! Read on to learn all about baby growth spurts: what they are, what signs to look out for, and how to deal with them.
        What Are Growth Spurts?
        A growth spurt refers to a period of intense, rapid growth in a short period of time. You may notice that your infant or toddler seems to have grown overnight when this happens. 
        Length (height) and weight are the two most obvious measures of growth in a baby. During the first year, babies on average add about 10 inches (25 centimeters) in length and triple their birth weight. Babies' heads also grow a lot, especially during the first four months. It's likely that your baby will grow at a fairly steady rate, but it’s also possible your infant will have what are called growth spurts.

        A Step-by-Step Guide to the 3-Day Potty Training Method
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200">
        You may have heard about various methods for potty training a toddler, one of them being the three-day potty-training method. Although there is no foolproof potty training strategy that works for every child, you may decide that this intensive, boot camp–style training method is the right one for you and your child. Read on to learn how to implement this method and to gather tips about potty training in general.
        Choosing Among Potty-Training Methods
        Whether you choose to try the three-day potty-training method or prefer a more gradual technique, it's helpful to know that there is no evidence that any one method is better than another. However, it’s best to start toilet training your child when they’re developmentally ready and when you’re able to commit to a positive and consistent approach.
        It’s also unnecessary to use to just one method. You could decide to do a combination of different potty-training methods to come up with something that works well for you and your child. Medical experts agree that children benefit when verbal, physical, and social forms of training are combined. These can include reading a book to your little one about potty training, letting them pick out their own potty chair, demonstrating to your child how to use the potty and wipe themselves afterward, and offering praise and hugs for a job well done.
        Work with your child and their personality to come up with the best combination of potty-training methods for your family. You’ll get to know your child and their unique style a little better, and you’ll appreciate seeing them grow into an individual.
        6 Tips to Follow During Potty Training
        Whether you’re starting potty training or you're already in the thick of it, here are some potty-training tips and techniques to keep in mind:
        Be ready when you notice the signs. If you see your toddler needs to use the potty, be quick to lead the way or grab the potty chair. Toddlers are often unaware of their need to go until the last minute.
        Gently remind your toddler to use the potty. Oftentimes when children get busy with an activity, they forget to go to the toilet or potty, which can lead to accidents. Consider reminding your child to use the potty every time you yourself need to use the toilet. This can help reaffirm for your child that everybody uses the toilet. As your child becomes older and more independent, you may need to pull back on reminders, as these can sometimes lead to resistance on your child’s part.
        Take notice of your child’s routines. Does your little one need to use the potty right away when they wake up, after meals, or after being in the car? Pay attention to your child's needs and habits and encourage them to follow through with using the potty at these times during the day.
        Offer encouragement. Potty training requires mastering different skills and steps, so be sure to notice your child's efforts along the way. For example, give them a high five when they tell you (without prompting by you) that they need to go, and when they’ve successfully used the potty themselves.
        Keep your cool when accidents happen. In the early stages, you may need to help your child clean up after an accident and change their clothes. But, as they are able, gently encourage them to help with the cleanup and change their own pants after an accident, not as a form of punishment but as a step toward greater independence. 
        Be patient and positive. Potty training takes time. There may be setbacks, such as potty-training regression, so keep a positive attitude and always look on the bright side: Your child will eventually be potty trained!

        Quickening: When Can You Feel Your Baby Move and Kick?
      </h5>
      <p className="mb-4 text-base text-neutral-600 dark:text-neutral-200">
        One of the most memorable moments of your pregnancy journey will likely be feeling your little one’s first tiny flutterings. This moment—the very first time you feel your baby move—is called quickening. Know that babies move before you can detect any activity; quickening simply refers to the first time you feel the movement. So, when can you feel your baby move, and what does baby movement feel like? Read on to learn about this exciting pregnancy milestone and what to anticipate after that first thrilling sensation!</p>
      <h2>What Is Quickening in Pregnancy?</h2>
      <p>Quickening has a fairly straightforward definition: It’s the first time you feel your baby move. But it’s important to know that fetal movement is much more complex, and that your little one is certainly moving around more than you know! Quickening is when you first feel the movement, not the first time it occurs. 
        Your baby may start moving around in the womb at about 12 weeks, but you probably won’t be aware of any activity at this early stage. Fetal movement encompasses all types of action in the womb, including what your baby is doing before you can feel them move. </p>
      <h2>How Early Can You Feel Your Baby Move?</h2>
      <p>A common question about quickening in pregnancy is “When do you start feeling your baby move?” The timing of quickening varies, but it may occur at around 18 weeks of pregnancy if this is your first baby. But, of course, everyone is different, so it’s perfectly normal to experience quickening earlier or later than 18 weeks.
        But how early you feel your baby move with your second pregnancy can be different, possibly closer to 16 weeks. If you’ve been pregnant before, your uterine muscles might be more sensitive to movement, which is why second pregnancy symptoms might be a little different, such as experiencing quickening slightly earlier than first-time parents. 
        It’s also important to keep in mind that some babies are generally more active than others, so if your little one is a bit more relaxed, you might not feel quickening and subsequent movements until later. Contact your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns.</p>
      <h2>What Does Quickening Feel Like?</h2>
      <p>Not everyone is familiar with the term quickening, but perhaps you’ve heard about “pregnancy flutters,” which is how many describe the feeling. 
        In addition to flutters, what do quickening movements feel like? Quickening can feel different for everyone, but other ways to describe it include
        tapping
        tiny pulses
        flickering
        little gas bubbles popping
        small muscle spasms
        light rolls or tumbles.
        Don’t worry if you can’t decipher what it is you’re feeling! Quickening will be subtle, but as time goes on your baby’s movements will become stronger and more apparent. The Bottom Line
        Quickening in pregnancy is an exciting milestone that you might be anticipating. By definition, quickening is when you feel your baby move for the first time, though they’ll move around your uterus before you can feel them! Once quickening occurs, you’ll start feeling your baby move more and more as they grow bigger and more active.
        When can you feel your baby move, and how early does quickening occur? Every pregnancy is different, but it’s typical to experience quickening around 18 weeks. If you’ve been pregnant before, your uterine muscles might be a little more sensitive to movement, so it’s possible to experience that first feeling earlier, such as around 16 weeks. But it could occur earlier or later, and that’s normal.
        By 20 to 24 weeks, you’ll likely start feeling regular movement, and as you enter your third trimester, you can anticipate baby kicks, jabs, stretches, hiccups, and somersaults! Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about fetal movement. 
        Quickening often feels like little pregnancy flutters, an exciting milestone in your journey! Know that those movements are a positive sign and a chance to bond with your new baby.
