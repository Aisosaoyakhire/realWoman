We only accept advertising and sponsorship opportunities from companies whose product and services we would use ourselves. (Yes, as financially painful as it can be, we do turn away advertisers and sponsors.)

If a product or service review is a sponsored one, we will fully disclose that fact. If we receive a product for free, that is mentioned in our story as well.

If you are a company and would like to reach our community of moms, we would love to talk to you and create a customizable program that achieves your marketing objectives.
